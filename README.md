Artificer's Miscellanea
========
Artificer's Miscellanea: The mod you never knew you didn't need, for a version of the game that is five years outdated!

Artificer's Miscellanea was born from a simple dream, to have a tokamak in a skyblock world. Then I thought, "Go big or go home, build a giant golden banana", and decided to ad Ex Nihilo support to mods that didn't really need it (on the other hand, I can have GeoStrata in a skyblock pack now, although I only realized Chisel handles that after I made the compatability stuff). Then I thought, "Who wants overly complicated Metallurgy tweaks and ridiculous new alloys in a SEPERATE mod?", so I threw it in. Then I thought, "I'd like some bionics, from the Greek for, like, kick ass. Yup, yup, yup." Then I took a shower at night and came up with the name. Then I went to sleep.

Artificer's Miscellanea will eventually become a bunch of unrelated tweaks and additions, befitting the name. It will be in a similar vein to Extra Utilities, OpenBlocks, Artifce, or Random Things, with a heavy eye on integration with and between various mods. I plan to make it highly modular within a unified package, so you can choose what you want. I will be adding things as I play as to not become burnt out, so development will be spotty, like anything else I've made, except things might actually get done now. For possible additions, see TODO.md.

## Compiling from Source
Note: Git MUST be installed and in the system path to use our scripts.
* Setup: Run [gradle]in the repository root: `gradlew[.bat] [setupDevWorkspace|setupDecompWorkspace] [eclipse|idea]`
* Build: Run [gradle]in the repository root: `gradlew[.bat] build`
* If obscure Gradle issues are found try running `gradlew clean` and `gradlew cleanCache`

## Development (IntelliJ)


## Issue reporting
Please include the following:

* Forge version/build
* Artificer's Miscellanea version
* Versions of any mods potentially related to the issue 
* Any relevant screenshots are greatly appreciated, if applicable.
* For crashes:
	* Steps to reproduce
	* ForgeModLoader-client-0.log (the FML log) from the root folder of the client

## Licensing
Currently deciding on an actual license, but the following three things will always be a thing, so don't worry:
* Modpacks are cool, so long as you credit me, handle bug reports (users who can report bugs properly are fine to report them), are using all mods with permission, and don't distribute custom builds of Artificer's Miscellanea without permission (mostly to prevent fruitless bug hunts on my end).
* You can port Artificer's Miscellanea to more recent (or less recent if you are so inclined) versions of Minecraft, again just credit me.
* You can use and learn from my code (but not copy it in its entirety), but I'd prefer if you made anything used visible source, so that others can learn from your code as well.

## Legal Bullshit

-As per terms of the Railcraft license, I must state that I have used Railcraft code in creating my integration-y Poor Ores, all code from Railcraft is marked as such.
